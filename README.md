
# 🤖 Intent Classification with BERT

A smart **Intent Classification** project that classifies user queries (text or voice) into predefined intents such as `greeting`, `book_hotel`, `order_food`, etc. Built using Hugging Face Transformers and trained in Google Colab.



## ✨ Features

* 🔹 **Text & Voice Input** support (convert speech to text before classification).
* 🔹 **BERT / Transformer-based** intent classifier.
* 🔹 **Dynamic intent training** – add new intents easily via JSON.
* 🔹 **Confidence Score** output for each prediction.
* 🔹 Cleaned notebook, compatible with **GitHub rendering**.



## ⚙️ Installation

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/intent-classification.git
cd intent-classification
```


## 📊 Example

**Input:**

```
I want to book hotel rooms in Delhi
```

**Predicted Intent:**

```
book_hotel
Confidence: 0.91
```



## 🧠 Future Improvements

* 🔹 Add support for **multi-intent classification**
* 🔹 Deploy model as a **REST API (Flask/FastAPI)**
* 🔹 Build a simple **UI chatbot** around it
